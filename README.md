# Nuclear-Winter
FPS Game done in Unity.
Project was done with one other person with contributions being scattered wherever they were needed as this was a timed project. 
Also included is a writeup of the ideal specifications of the project(as unfortunately some of them were not met due to time constraints), as well as a demo(Windows only) of the actual game. The game is fully online and able to be ran in multiple instances on a single PC, but
will also work online from PC to PC given that both machines have internet access. To test online feature open two instances of the client, host a room on one of them and in the other client refresh the existing rooms and join the room being currently hosted by the other instance. Controls are WASD to move, space to fly, mouse to control camera, left click to shoot, and R to reload.
